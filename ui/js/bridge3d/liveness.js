// liveness.js — which of the crew is working, and which one wants him.
//
// The roadmap's headline finding was that the room read **none** of the state
// the board already serves: `status.worker.state`, `owed`, `owedState`,
// `unread`, `activity`, `chatOwed`. The server derives all of it on every
// payload and the room threw it away at the door, then drew the board's
// structure — which is the part a flat kanban already does better.
//
// This is the door opening. `world.md`: *an object that never moves is
// furniture*, and a dead process is a still object, which beats any status
// string because it cannot go stale.
//
// Three states and no more, because the question he actually asks this board is
// "who needs me", and a vocabulary with six answers does not answer it faster:
//
//   wants-you  something of theirs is waiting on HIM
//   working    a worker of theirs is running right now
//   idle       neither — and idle is STILL, which is what makes the other two
//              legible at all
//
// Pure: no three.js, no DOM, one function of the board payload. That is
// deliberate — what "working" means is a rule about the board, and a rule about
// the board should be arguable in a test rather than only in a headset.

// Precedence matters and it is not alphabetical: a lieutenant who is both
// running a worker AND sitting on something unread is one he needs to look at,
// so wants-you wins. The louder state is never masked by the busier one.
