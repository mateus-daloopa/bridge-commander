// agents.js — the lieutenants, as eight spheres that never move.
//
// Eight is small enough that a stable arc becomes a memorised landmark set for
// free, and that is the entire win here — so the positions are FIXED and are
// never sorted, reflowed or reordered for any reason. The roster fills the arc
// from the middle outward in a permanent order, which means a lieutenant joining
// never shifts one that is already there, and a half-crewed board is still
// centred rather than piled against one wall.
//
// The arc runs from 0° at the ends to +5° in the middle, above the shelves and
// never higher: looking up is the fastest route to a sore neck.
//
// And they are ALIVE. Each berth reads the board's own liveness — a running
// worker, a card waiting on the captain, an unanswered reply — and moves on it:
// a bob while a worker of theirs is running, a lift and a pulse when something
// of theirs wants him, and dead stillness otherwise. Motion driven by real
// state, never by a spinner: `world.md` is blunt that an object which never
// moves is furniture, and that a dead process is a still object, which beats
// any status string because it cannot go stale.
//
// Walking in and looking once should answer "who needs me", which is the only
// question he ever really asks this board.
