// voice3d.js — a lieutenant's voice comes from where the lieutenant is standing.
//
// The room does NOT have a speech path of its own, and must not grow one. Which
// messages get spoken, whose voice speaks them, one at a time in a queue, the
// engine, the transport, the failure that says so out loud — all of that is
// `../voice.js`, which the flat board has been using since long before there was
// a room. This file is two small things bolted onto it:
//
// **A gesture.** `enter the bridge` is the click that starts the music bed, and
// it is the same click that turns the speech on. A room the captain walked into
// on purpose, with a bed already playing, that stays mute because a toggle on
// another page is off, is a bug he would report — so the room asks for sound.
// It does not REMEMBER that: the flat board's toggle stays his.
//
// **A direction.** On a flat board a message comes from the screen, so there is
// nowhere for it to come from and voice.js sends the sound straight out. Here
// the one who said it is standing on the arc, two metres away, and the whole
// reason this is worth doing in a headset rather than in a tab is that the voice
// arrives from that berth. So the room hands voice.js a route (speech.js's
// `route` hook), and the route is a panner placed where that lieutenant is.
//
// The panner is in SPEECH.JS'S context, not the room's. It has to be — the sound
// is rendered there, into the MediaStream the <audio> element plays, which is
// the whole reason the OS treats the page as a media player. Nothing about that
// element is touched. What it costs is that its context's listener has to be
// moved with the head too, which is `sound.alsoHear()`.
//
// Distance does NOT attenuate: `rolloffFactor = 0`. The berths are fixed and
// close, so distance carries no information here, and the only thing an inverse
// curve would buy is a crew that is quieter in a headset than on the board for
// no reason. Direction is the whole point; loudness stays exactly as it was.

// one and an immersive session composites no page at all, so every way the board
