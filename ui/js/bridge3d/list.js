// list.js — the mat on the floor that opens the board.

// This file used to hold a flat list of every card as well: rows you could read
// but not press, on a panel of its own. The board panel replaced it outright —
// same cards, readable titles, a filter, and every row one press deep — and two
// surfaces answering "where is that card" is a room he has to learn twice.
//
// What survives is the mat, which was always the good half: a control you
// glance DOWN at, below the band everything readable is held to, in the lane
// between the middle shelves where nothing else lives. It is deliberately not a
// surface you read, which is the only reason it is allowed to sit down there —
// still inside the 60° a neck will comfortably go to.

// characters and 'the board' has already taken a line's worth of the depth —
// which leaves four lines, eighty characters. 'speech failed: ' plus whatever
// the engine said is unbounded, and type that runs off the plate is orange on
// pale stone, which is none of the contrast the colour was chosen for.

// It was a translucent dark plate with dim type, which was right in a black room
// and became invisible the moment the room got a stone floor: measured on the
// rendered frame it was 1.24:1 against the deck and its own label was 1.78:1
// against it. So it takes the same grammar as every panel — an opaque dark
// plate, light type, and a bright rim carrying the shape — which is high
// contrast against pale stone in both directions.
