// panel.js — a surface with prose on it that he can read, move, and put down.
//
// This is the piece the room was missing. Everything before it could be POINTED
// at and nothing could be READ, which is the difference between a museum and a
// place you work. A panel is deliberately flat and deliberately near: text stays
// flat, and comfort peaks between 1.0 and 2.0 m.
//
// Every size on it is authored in DEGREES at the distance it stands — see
// `world.js` for the figures and the `vr-design` skill for why they are those
// figures. At 1.10 m and 34° x 34° the body type is 1.4° of em box, which is
// 49 characters across and eleven lines down once the bar and the composer have
// taken their two 6.06° hit floors. That number is the whole design: it is what
// makes a card body readable rather than a scrolling chore.
//
// The geometry arrives as a `spec` rather than being baked in, because the
// board is the same machinery at a different size: its rows are things he
// PRESSES, so each needs the 6° hit floor, and three of those is not a board.
//
// Three parts, and the split is functional rather than decorative:
//
//   · the BAR is the handle. It is the only part that answers a squeeze, so
//     grabbing a window can never be confused with pressing something on it.
//   · the BODY is prose. It scrolls, and nothing in it is a target.
//   · the FOOT is optional, and it is where a composer goes.
//
// A panel that has been placed by hand is never moved again by the room. A room
// that tidies itself behind your back is a room you cannot arrange.
