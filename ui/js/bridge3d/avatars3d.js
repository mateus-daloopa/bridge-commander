// avatars3d.js — the crew's faces, out of the sheet the board already ships.
//
// `ui/img/avatars.png` is an 8x8 grid, index 0-63, row-major, and the flat board
// has read it since the beginning (`ui/js/avatars.js`, by CSS background
// position). Nothing new is downloaded here: the same file, the same indices,
// the same meaning.
//
// **Why a slice per index rather than one texture with UV offsets.** The obvious
// trick — one shared texture, `repeat` 1/8 and an `offset` per cell — cannot
// survive uikit. Its `Image` drives the texture through `texture.matrix`
// directly, resetting it to identity every layout pass and composing its own
// object-fit and border transform into it. Anything written to `repeat`/`offset`
// is either ignored or fights that matrix, and eight faces sharing one texture
// would be eight components fighting over one matrix. A cell cut into its own
// small texture has no such argument: its whole extent IS the avatar, so
// object-fit does the right thing without being told anything.
//
// It is cut **lazily and cached**, so only the handful of indices a board
// actually uses is ever made — eight lieutenants, eight little textures, rather
// than sixty-four cut on the chance somebody picks them.
//
// The sheet is an asset, not an interface: nothing here paints type, and the
// canvas is a pair of scissors rather than a drawing surface.
