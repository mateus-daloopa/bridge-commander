// main.js — the board as a world you stand inside.
//
// The first room was a wall of live terminals and the captain killed it in one
// sentence. The second was panels — pictures of the board hanging in the air.
// The third was shelves of card-shaped slabs, and he could point at them but
// could not read a word: they were 1.19:1 against the surface they stood on,
// which is not "small", it is invisible.
//
// This is the fourth, and the difference is that it is a room he can WORK in.
// What is permanently there is small and legible: the crew, an aligned floor,
// and a mat. Everything else arrives when he asks for it and leaves when he is
// done — a chat, the board, a card — and lives wherever he puts it.
//
// It is now a room he can work in rather than look at. The lieutenants are the
// arc above: point at one and its conversation opens as a panel he can read,
// type into and put where he likes. The mat on the floor opens the board —
// every card, filterable, one press deep — and a press on a card brings its
// body and its thread forward on a surface of their own. Squeeze a title bar to
// pick a window up; once he has placed it, the room never moves it again.
//
// Every number is authored in DEGREES and lives in `world.js`; why those are the
// numbers lives in the `vr-design` skill and nowhere else. See the README beside
// this file for how to run and photograph it without a headset.
