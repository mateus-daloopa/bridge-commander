// chat.js — talking to a lieutenant, from inside the room.
//
// This is the thing the captain most wants out of the room, and it is the one
// that decides whether any of it was worth building: everything else here is
// looking, and this is the only part that is TALKING. "O chat com o tenente" —
// the lieutenants are how he works, so a room he cannot speak from is a room he
// will visit once.
//
// The panel is `panel.js` with two additions: the thread painted newest at the
// bottom, and a composer in the foot.
//
// **Input, honestly.** The composer is a `Field` — a surface the room draws and
// paints itself; nothing here is ever rendered by the browser. A paired
// Bluetooth keyboard delivers keydown to the document regardless of focus,
// main.js hears it at the window, and it goes to whichever composer holds the
// keys — opening a chat is an intention to talk, so this one takes them, and
// Enter sends.
//
// **And he can just say it.** The Quest system keyboard is off in the room
// because raising it takes the browser down (MNC-87), which left a room with no
// way to put a sentence in it at all unless a keyboard was paired. So the foot
// carries a bar he HOLDS: the whole width of the panel, one press deep, and
// while he holds it the words appear on the strip above — over the board's own
// origin, through `/api/stt` (talk.js). Let go and the bar becomes two: send
// it, or say it again. There is no editing and there was never going to be —
// correcting a word without a keyboard costs more than repeating the sentence.
//
// Which lieutenant is about to hear it is the panel itself: his face and his
// colour are in the bar above, and this surface only ever posts to its own
// `target`.
//
// Sending is `POST /api/feedback` — the captain side of chat.say. Write-ahead:
// the server queues the delivery before it wakes anybody, so a message never
// depends on a session being alive at the moment it is sent.
