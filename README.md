As you work with AI, your **attention gets fragmented** — driving multiple planning tasks while
overseeing multiple implementation tasks. Chat quickly becomes the wrong UX for piloting a fleet
of agents.

This skill lets you use Claude Code / Codex as multiple chiefs of staff (**lieutenants**). You
get a web UI where you work together, as work items get done by independent agent sessions on a
kanban board.

## Install

One skill:

```sh
npx skills add tonylampada/bridge-commander -g -y
```

That's it. The rest happens in the terminal you already have.

## Start

- Make an empty folder (e.g. `myfleet`) and start `claude` in it
- (Recommended) Set permissions mode to auto
- `/bridge-commander`
- Open the board URL it prints (default `http://localhost:4780/`)

**Bridget** is already there with a message waiting. She's your first lieutenant, and she does the
rest of the setup with you.

You need `tmux` and `git` on the machine (Bridget will offer to install if missing). 
You never have to use tmux yourself, but you can if you want.

## Configuration

Per-workspace config lives in `.bridge-commander/config.json`:

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `port` | `4780` | server port (also `--port N` on `init`/`open`) |
| `host` | `127.0.0.1` | bind address — see network exposure below |
| `harness` | `claude` | default agent harness (`claude` \| `codex`) |
| `voices` | — | UI text-to-speech voice filter |
| `tts` | — | speak agent messages through an external TTS engine: `{"url": "http://127.0.0.1:8883", "lang": "pt", "voice": null, "params": {}}` (voxbench API). Absent = the board stays silent. The **server** reaches the engine: the browser talks to `/api/tts/*` on the board's own origin and the url only has to be reachable from the machine running the server (no CORS, no tailnet on the phone) |

Env knobs (set on the server process):

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `BC_SUPERVISE_INTERVAL_MS` | `30000` | supervision tick (lieutenant respawn, dead-worker detection); `0` disables |
| `BC_PRWATCH_INTERVAL_MS` | `120000` | PR watch tick; `0` disables |
| `BC_UPLOAD_MAX_BYTES` | `10485760` | per-file chat upload cap |
| `BC_WORKER_TTL_SECS` | `600` | card status lease TTL — `working`/`needs-you` decays to `idle` past it |
| `BC_WORKTREE_TOOL` | auto | `treehouse` \| `git` — worker worktree provisioning |
| `BC_HARNESS_STATE` | `~/.bridge-commander/harness` | harness state dir (prompts, session ids, turn-end logs) |
| `BC_GH_CMD` | `gh` | gh binary used by the PR watch and by the packaged `gh-watch` hook |
| `BC_SCHEDULE_INTERVAL_MS` | `15000` | schedule tick — how often the clock looks for due windows; `0` disables |
| `BC_TURNEND_URL` | — | default callback URL baked into installed turn-end hooks |
| `BC_SEND_RETRIES` / `BC_SEND_SLEEP_MS` | `3` / `400` | verified-submit tuning for `harness.send` |
| `BC_HOOK_TIMEOUT_MS` | `120000` | per-script timeout for workspace hooks, lifecycle and named alike |
| `BC_TEARDOWN_TIMEOUT_MS` | `300000` / `60000` | timeout for a playbook's `teardown` command — 5 min at the handoff and archive (un-awaited), 60s at a rework restart (awaited inside `card start`); set, it overrides both |
| `BC_TTS_IDLE_MS` | `20000` | how long the TTS passthrough waits for the next byte from the engine before hanging up — a gap between bytes, not a cap on the request |
| `BC_SYSLOAD_MS` | `2000` | monitoring panel (⚙️ → machine load) sample interval; the sampler runs only while the panel is open |

### Network exposure

The board has **no application-level auth** — whoever reaches the bind address fully controls
the board, including starting workers (running code):

- **Default (recommended): loopback only** (`127.0.0.1`).
- Private mesh (e.g. Tailscale): set `host` to that interface's address; a loopback listener is
  kept alongside. The mesh is your only auth boundary.
- **Never bind `0.0.0.0`.**

How it works inside: [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md). The conceptual API
([docs/api/overview.md](docs/api/overview.md)) is the spec the implementation follows.
